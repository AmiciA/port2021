  <h2>🎏 About Me</h2>
  <blockquote>
    Anthony Amici (that's me) is a designer from the States—Pennsylvania in particular. I graduated with a BFA in New Media Design from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2016, along the way studying abroad at the Bauhaus in Dessau🇩🇪 and completing an internship in Biel/Bienne🇨🇭.
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <blockquote>
    I've always been driven by the intersection of <i>creativity and organisation</i> and am happiest working in a multidisciplinary, small team setting on projects where I can bring logical structure and a pleasant user journey to complex systems.
  </blockquote>
  
  
  <blockquote>
    Currently, I am based in the wistfully beautiful Hong Kong🇭🇰 along with <a href="http://hop-design.studio" target="_blank">my wife</a>. If I'm not coding up a new game or working on some personal project, I'll probably be out for a run or hike🏞, playing with our rabbits🐰, or doing something the CCP wouldn't approve of. 🤬

  <!-- CLIENT WORK -->
  
  <h2>💻 Client work</h2>
  <blockquote>
    Currently, I am the lead designer at <a href="http://grayscale.com.hk" target="_blank">Grayscale</a>, building websites, apps, and any other little bits and pieces of design to go with them for clients such as Sealy, thyssenkrupp, Mercedes-Benz, and multiple top Hong Kong universities.

    <p>
      Following a radical rebrand earlier in the decade, CUHK's faculty of business needed to apply their new branding in a unified way across its varied programme sites, all while balancing internal communication objectives with inspiring success stories. Before beginning our redesign, I worked with another designer to conduct focus group sessions and one-on-one interviews with students and staff.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Feedback from these sessions informed the rest of the design process and even helped to identify a previously overlooked stakeholder category: non-English speaking parents of undergrads. With wide range of sites designed under the same style, I naturally worked with our developer to create a pattern library that has since informed the development of further sites commissioned by the Business School.

    <p>
      This ethical lending company offering low-interest loans to domestic helpers turned to Grayscale for design, prototyping, and development of their new app, aiming ultimately to increase financial literacy among this disadvantaged population in Hong Kong.
    </p>
    <p>  
      I was involved in the initial agile design process, eventually becoming responsible for prototyping and testing user flows and the development of a unified design system for the final app. I was also employed on an ad-hoc basis for the production of other digital and printed collateral, such as promotional campaigns and a pitch deck for continued fundraising.

      Working with founder and longtime global trade advocate Merle Hinrich to update his foundation’s corporate messaging was certainly a unique experience. I conducted dozens of in-person and over-the-phone user interviews &amp; UX research for this project. The results of this research, and the hours of review sessions with the team, informed the many iterations of high-fidelity wireframes &amp; prototypes we created, which we then worked with a branding and development agency to implement.

      A pan-Asian provider of short- and long-stay serviced apartments, Lanson Place contacted Grayscale and branding agency Eight for a full redesign of their corporate identity, with their family of 12(!) websites included. After some on-site visits and over-the-phone interviews with staff elsewhere in Asia, I worked alongside the branding agency to translate their new look into a cohesive digital design system. This project is still ongoing, as we constantly adapt and tweak our design system to fit the steady stream of incoming content from the different properties.

    <p>
      This Swiss asset management firm is a longtime client of Grayscale's. I was responsible for their initial site redesign, which encompassed the development of a completely new corporate identity, as well as a second daughter site a year later. These sites required massive time input to first comprehend the intricacies of Silverhorn's business, and then to figure out the best way to convey those complexities to their clients. In a few areas of the site, I designed interactive and animated 2D &amp; 3D graphics to explain in detail an investment process or graphically communicate a core concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, as we established ourself as Silverhorn's design partner, my responsibilities expanded to include taking care of ad-hoc design tasks and the production of documents, reports, and presentations for use internally or to send out to their own clients.

      I worked with Prof. Lastra from The University of Hong Kong to transform her students’ final projects from boring Word files to a unique digital presence. Despite the tight budget, we allowed the students to create their own uniquely-designed article pages with the ability to embed multimedia content. In addition to the design of an interactive map plotting the students' chosen artefacts along medieval pilgrimage routes, I also created patterns and graphics for this very non-standard web project.

    <p>
      I recently worked with thyssenkrupp Elevator’s marketing team, a local brand agency, and a longtime development partner to devise a more uniform way for employees to create sales presentations. We performed user interviews with staff across Asia, developed an information architecture and in-depth user flows, and designed the visuals of the tool itself, as well as printed brochure and presentation outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latest phase of the project, I worked with a content strategist to map and analyse existing content to find any gaps in their photography and copywriting. Currently, we are working on a design system to govern all of the company's (since rebranded as TKE) internal tools.
